I will be deploying to the AWS with microservices

Tasks
    Kubernetes Deployment:
        Create a VPC in AWS with both public and private subnets.(Can be found in the root files.)
        Deploy a Kubernetes cluster in AWS using EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) in the private subnet.(Can be found in the root files.)
        Deploy a sample application of your choice into the Kubernetes cluster. The application should have at least two microservices.
        terraform init
        terraform apply
        kubectl apply -f k8s-app.yaml

    GitOps Workflow:
        Implement a GitOps workflow using ArgoCD for managing the deployment of applications in the Kubernetes cluster.
        Create a Git repository to store Kubernetes manifests for your sample application.
        Configure the GitOps tool to continuously synchronize the state of the cluster with the desired state specified in the Git repository.

    AWS Integration:
        Integrate an Amazon RDS instance for database storage.
        Implement AWS Secrets Manager to securely manage sensitive information (e.g., database credentials) used by the application.

    Scaling and Auto-Healing:
        Implement Horizontal Pod Autoscaling (HPA) for one or more components of your sample application.
        Configure the Kubernetes cluster for automatic scaling based on resource utilization.

    Monitoring and Logging:
        Integrate AWS CloudWatch for monitoring and logging of the Kubernetes cluster and the deployed application.
        Set up alerts for critical events or performance thresholds.

    Documentation and GitOps Repository:
        Provide comprehensive documentation on the entire setup, including steps for deploying the Kubernetes cluster, GitOps workflow, AWS integration, and monitoring/logging configuration.
        Include a README.md file in your GitOps repository explaining the directory structure, how to contribute, and how the GitOps workflow operates.
